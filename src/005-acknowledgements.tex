\chapter{Acknowledgments}%
\label{chap:acknowledgements}

Without a doubt, the acknowledgments are the most widely and most eagerly read part of any thesis.
Therefore, I firstly want to thank the pizza place down the street for keeping me alive throughout this entire project. Without your perfectly-timed pepperoni deliveries, this thesis might have turned into a half-hearted collection of sad salad thoughts.

To the coffee shop next door: you are the true \glspl{MVP}. Without your seemingly endless supply of caffeine, I would have never made it past the first draft. My gratitude extends to the barista who managed to make my "quad-shot, extra-hot, no-whip, soy latte" without judgment --- you kept my brain firing long after it should have crashed.

I also owe thanks to the office building itself. Your flickering fluorescent lights, occasional power outages, and truly confusing elevator system gave me something to grumble about when I needed a break from grumbling about my actual work. You helped build character --- or at least a tolerance for cold drafts and inconsistent Wi-Fi, at which point the coffee machine also broke down.

Special thanks to the janitor who always seemed to vacuum right when I hit my creative peak. Your impeccable timing has truly made me a stronger, more flexible writer --- able to pivot even in the face of the loudest industrial cleaning equipment known to man.

Lastly, to my advisor, for whom no thanks is too much.
